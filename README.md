## Welcomeüñê
Hello there, i'm **dyz**! i  make small prototypes on Unity. I used to mod Flash Games and was very good at it at one point.
This is currently my most worked on project üëá(not as much work on feburary)
- [Madness: CN2047](https://discord.com/invite/ZY3fSbKKMQ), was a planned remake of *Madness Accelerant*, turned into Fangame! Taking inspiration from Madness Accelerant, Madness Interactive Reloaded, Zombotron and more, i hope to make an engaging game while also not forgetting the core... **Madness. Moar Madness**

## About meü§î
I'm a programmer, my early programming years started with HTML and later i learnt Unity C#. Currently learning haxe, as it is similiar to AS3, the language I learnt to mod Flash games. I am very active on discord, and i like to mostly talk about thought invoking discussions.

This year i hope to also achive another thing... Commits all year! i want to fill those black squares with a viberant green color, every single oneüòâ

DM me on discord(dyzqy) as it is the only social platform i use other than NewGrounds. Thank you for reading this ramble of a random guy and thank you!
