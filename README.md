## Welcomeüñê
Hello there, i'm **dyz**! i  make small prototypes on Unity. I used to mod Flash Games and was very good at it at one point.
This is currently my most worked on project üëá
- [Madness: CN2047](https://discord.com/invite/ZY3fSbKKMQ), was a planned remake of *Madness Accelerant*, turned into Fangame! Taking inspiration from Madness Accelerant, Madness Interactive Reloaded, Zombotron and more, i hope to make an engaging game while also not forgetting the core... **Madness. Moar Madness**

## About meü§î
I'm a programmer, my early programming years started with HTML and later i learnt Unity C#. I am active on discord, and i like to mostly talk abou thought invoking discussions.
I have chosen this year to do somethign great, i want to make a game before reaching 17 years old. I'm currently 16, and have till April to make the game. Why? Well, i like a well rounded number better than 17.

This year i hope to also achive another thing... Commits all year! i want to fill those black squares with a viberant green color, every single oneüòâ

DM me on discord(dyzqy) as it is the only social platform i use other than NewGrounds. Thank you for reading this ramble of a random kid and thank you!
